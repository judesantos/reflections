How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Diagrams help by visually creating a tree structure of branches and the chonoogical order of commits within each branch, and also helps identify parent branch.

	With this, merging and pulling out code to create new versions, test out a new feature, incorporating new features are less confusing.

What is the result of mergin two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	
What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic vs. always doing merges manually.

	Manual merge is good when the difference between 2 branches requires human decision to affect the final outcome. Automatic merge is good for simple merges, like 2 differing sections of code on the same file, or separate changes in code, or adding new files.
